# rlox

Tree-walk Lox interpreter from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) written in Rust.

## Testing
`tests/` contains a modified `jlox` test suite from [the official Lox implementation](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters).

`test.sh` runs every file and compares the output to the commented output (`///` for an actual comment).
